title: Configuration spaces of disks in an infinite strip
abstract: "(This is joint work with Bob MacPherson.) Configurations spaces of points,
  in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ for example, are well studied in algebraic topology. We understand
  the homology, homotopy groups, etc., extremely well. But if the points have some
  finite thickness, and if the region of the plane is restricted, then much less is
  known. However this situation is quite natural from the point of view of physics---such
  configuration spaces describe the phase space or energy landscape of a hard spheres
  gas. As a case study, we investigate the configuration space of $n$ disks of unit
  radius in an infinite strip of width $w$. We are especially interested in the asymptotic
  behavior of the $k$th Betti number as $n \\to \\infty$, and we find two regimes.
  For some choices of $(w,k)$, the $k$th Betti number grows polynomially fast, and
  for some it grows exponentially fast. The line separating these two regimes might
  be considered a kind of phase transition. Our main results are asymptotic estimates
  for the Betti numbers in every case, correct up to a constant factor."
