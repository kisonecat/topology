title: Trace methods in Real algebraic K-theory
abstract: 'The Hermitian K-theory of a ring with an antistructure is a topological
  group completion for the monoid of Hermitian forms on the ring. Recent work of Hesselholt
  and Madsen describes Hermitian K-theory as the fixed points of a genuine Z/2-spectrum:
  the Real K-theory spectrum of the ring. Their construction uses a variant of Waldhausen''s
  Sdot construction on categories with duality. This categorical approach makes it
  possible to construct trace maps to Real variants of THH and TC, as maps of Z/2-spectra.
  The talk will focus on how, via the trace map, ``the equivariant Goodwillie derivative
  of Real K-theory is Real THH.'''''
