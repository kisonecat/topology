title: On the Algebraic K-theory of Brave New Tensor Algebras
abstract: Waldhausen's A-theory of a space $X$ is sometimes described as the ``universal
  Euler class''. Along these lines, the ``universal generalized Lefschetz class''
  of an endomorphism would be the reduced algebraic K-theory of an associated ``brave
  new'' tensor algebra. Recent joint work with Ayelet Lindenstrauss describing this
  spectrum, when one is working in an analytic range (in the sense of Goodwillie's
  calculus of functors) will be discussed.\nFor $\pi_0$, these results go back to
  Almkvist, Rincki and L\"uck. More generally these results are related to the theses
  of Lydakis and  Iwachita which built upon the computation of the $A$-theory of the
  suspension of a space by Carlsson, Cohen, Goodwillie and Hsiang.
