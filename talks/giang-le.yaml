title: The action dimension of Artin groups
abstract: The action dimension of a discrete group $G$ is the minimum dimension of
  a contractible manifold, on which group $G$ acts properly discontinuously. We will
  prove that the action dimension for an Artin group with the nerve $L$ of dimension
  $n$ is less than or equal to $2n + 1$ if the Artin group satisfies the $K(\pi, 1)$
  conjecture and the top cohomology group of $L$ with $\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients is
  trivial.
