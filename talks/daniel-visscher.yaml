title: Anosov geodesic flows on surfaces embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$
abstract: The dynamics of a geodesic flow on a Riemannian manifold are generated by the metric. In this talk, we are interested in metrics on surfaces that produce uniformly hyperbolic (Anosov) dynamics. There are canonical examples of such metrics, such as those of constant negative curvature and, more generally, of strictly negative curvature. On the other hand, there are also restrictions on which metrics can support such dynamics. Conjugate points were shown by Klingenberg to be an obstruction to Anosov geodesic flows--this implies that neither the sphere nor the torus can support an Anosov geodesic flow, regardless of the metric. However, it is possible for a surface to have a fair amount of positive curvature and still generate an Anosov geodesic flow. In this talk, I will present a new proof of a result of Donnay and Pugh that shows the existence of surfaces with Anosov geodesic flows whose metrics come from embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and I will discuss an estimate for the genus of such a surface. This is work with V. Donnay.
