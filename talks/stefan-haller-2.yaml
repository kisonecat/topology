title: The cohomology of symplectic fiber bundles
abstract: The deRham cohomology of a Poisson manifold comes equipped with a canonical filtration. For symplectic manifolds this filtration is well understood and can be computed from the cup product action of the cohomology class represented by the symplectic form. In this talk we will discuss said filtration for the total space of sympletic fiber bundles. The latter constitute a class of Poisson manifolds closely related to the topology of the sympletic group of the typical fiber.
