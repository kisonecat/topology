title: Involutions on Tori and Topological Rigidity
abstract: How many involutions on the $n$ torus have an isolated fixed point?\nThis
  is a report of joint work with Jim Davis and Qayum Khan.\nWe prove  that there is
  only one involution on the $n$-torus, $T^n$, up to conjugacy, for which the fixed
  set contains an  isolated point.  But here, $n$ must be of the form $4k$ or $4k+1$  (or
  else, n must be $\leq 3$).  In the other dimensions, we classify all such involutions,
  using surgery theory and the calculation of the groups $UNil_n(Z,Z,Z).$\nWe also
  introduce a  Topological Rigidity Conjecture and we show that the above result is
  a consequence of it.
