title: When are two Coxeter orbifolds diffeomorphic?
abstract: One can define what it means for a compact manifold with corners to be a ``contractible manifold with contractible faces.'' Two combinatorially equivalent, contractible manifolds with contractible faces are diffeomorphic if and only if their $4$-dimensional faces are diffeomorphic.  It follows that two simple convex polytopes are combinatorially equivalent if and only if they are diffeomorphic as manifolds with corners.  On the other hand, by a result of Akbulut,  for each n greater than 3, there are smooth, contractible n-manifolds with contractible faces which are combinatorially equivalent but not diffeomorphic.  Applications are given to rigidity questions for reflection groups and smooth torus actions.
