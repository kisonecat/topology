title: On free $Z/p$ actions on products of spheres
abstract: We consider free actions of large prime order cyclic groups on products
  of spheres.  The equivariant homotopy type will be determined and the simple structure
  set discussed.  Similar to lens spaces, the first $k$-invariant generally determines
  the homotopy type, however for homotopy equivalences between products of an even
  number of spheres the Whitehead torsion vanishes and the quotients are also simple
  homotopy equivalent.  Unlike lens spaces which are determined by their Reidemeister
  torsion and $\rho$-invariant, the $\rho$-invariant vanishes for products of an even
  number of spheres and the Pontrjagin classes become p-localized homeomorphism invariants
  for a given dimension.  The cohomology classes, Pontrjagin classes, and the set
  of normal invariants will also be discussed.
