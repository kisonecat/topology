title: Intermediate Hopf-Galois Extensions and a New Construction of MU
abstract: We review the notion of a Hopf-Galois extension of ring spectra and construct a number of new intermediate Hopf-Galois extensions. We use this to introduce a new construction of MU which bears a striking resemblance to Lazard's construction of the Lazard ring.
