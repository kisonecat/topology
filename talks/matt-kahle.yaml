title: Sharp vanishing thresholds for cohomology of random flag complexes
abstract: " The random flag complex is a natural combinatorial model of random topological
  space.  In this talk I will survey some results about the expected topology of these
  objects, focusing on recent work which gives a sharp vanishing threshold for kth
  cohomology with rational coefficients.\\n This recent work provides a generalization
  of the Erdos-Renyi theorem which characterizes how many random edges one must add
  to an empty set of n vertices before it becomes connected.  As a corollary, almost
  all d-dimensional flag complexes have rational homology only in middle degree (d/2).\\n
  This is topology seminar, so I will assume that people know what homology and cohomology
  are, but I will strive to make the talk self contained and define all the necessary
  probability as we go."
