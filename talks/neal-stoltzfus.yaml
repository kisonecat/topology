title: Knots with Cyclic Symmetries and Recursion in Knot Polynomial of Link families
abstract: 'For knots invariant under a finite order cyclic symmetry, Seifert, Murasugi
  and others developed  relations constraining the Alexander polynomial of such knots.\nWe
  develop similar constraints using the transfer method of generating functions is
  applied to the ribbon graph rank polynomial. This polynomial, denoted $R(D;X,Y,Z)$,
  is due to  Bollob\''as, Riordan, Whitney and Tutte. Given a sequence of ribbon graphs,
  $D_n$, constructed by successive amalgamation of a fixed pattern ribbon graph, we
  prove by the transfer method that the associated sequence of rank polynomials is
  recursive:  that is, the polynomials $R(D_n;X,Y,Z)$ satisfy a linear recurrence
  relation with coefficients in $Z[X,Y,Z]$.\nWe develop conditions for the Jones polynomial
  of links which admit a periodic homeomorphism, by applying the above result and
  the work of Dasbach et al showing that the Jones polynomial is a specialization
  of the ribbon graph rank polynomial.\nThis is joint work with Jordan Keller and
  Murphy-Kate Montee)'
