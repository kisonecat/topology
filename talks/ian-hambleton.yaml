title: Co-compact discrete group actions and the assembly map
abstract: 'A discrete group $\Gamma$ can act freely and properly on $S^n \times R^m$,
  for some $n, m >0$ if and only if $\Gamma$ is a countable group with periodic Farrell
  cohomology: Connolly-Prassidis (1989) assuming $vcd(\Gamma)$ finite, Adem-Smith
  (2001). For free co-compact actions there are additional restrictions, but no general
  sufficient conditions are known. The talk will survey this problem and its connection
  to the Farrell-Jones assembly maps in K-theory and L-theory.'
