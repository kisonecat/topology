title: A New Algorithm in Group Theory
abstract: We describe a new algorithm which determines if the intersection of a quasiconvex subgroup of a negatively curved group with any of its conjugates is infinite. The algorithm is based on the concepts of a coset graph and a weakly Nielsen generating set of a subgroup. We also give a new proof of decidability of a membership problem for quasiconvex subgroups of negatively curved groups.
