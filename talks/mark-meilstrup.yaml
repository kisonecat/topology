title: Reduced forms for one-dimensional Peano continua
abstract: We will discuss a few reduced forms for homotopy types of 1-dim Peano continua. "Deforested" continua contain no attached strongly contractile subsets (dendrites). For 1-dim continua this always gives a minimal deformation retract, or core. In a core 1-dim continuum, the points which are not homotopically fixed form a graph. Furthermore, this can be homotoped to an "arc reduced" continuum, where the non-homotopically fixed points are in fact a union of arcs.
