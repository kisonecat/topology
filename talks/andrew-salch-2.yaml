title: The May spectral sequence for topological Hochschild homology
abstract: I give the construction of a "THH-May spectral sequence" which takes as
  input the topological Hochschild homology of the "associated graded ring spectrum"
  of a filtration of a ring spectrum by "ring spectrum ideals," and which outputs
  THH of the original ring spectrum. The construction of this spectral sequence turns
  out to be quite nontrivial and involves some new ideas.\nI describe in general terms
  how this spectral sequence looks for THH(K(F_q)), the topological Hochschild homology
  of the K-theory spectrum of certain finite fields; the detailed computation of the
  spectral sequence (computation of the differentials, etc.) is quite nontrivial,
  and is the topic of G. Angelini-Knoll's talk this same week (on Thursday). I also
  describe, in general terms, how this spectral sequence looks for THH of a connective
  model for the K(2)-local sphere, which involves new work of Bruner and Rognes on
  THH of the spectrum of topological modular forms.\nThese two THH computations are
  the input one needs for a trace method computation of the topological cyclic homology
  of connective models for the K(1)-local and K(2)-local sphere spectrum, which by
  a theorem of C. Ogle on the Goodwillie derivative of algebraic K-theory of ring
  spectra, computes the (relative) algebraic K-groups of these connective models for
  the K(1)-local and K(2)-local sphere spectrum. These are the first two presently-unknown
  lines in the Gersten spectral sequence E_1-term for the sphere spectrum; the computation
  of this Gersten spectral sequence is an old problem posed by Waldhausen. I will
  describe this point of view and its relationship to higher Chow groups and algebraic
  cycles in ring spectra.\nThis project is joint work with C. Ogle and G. Angelini-Knoll.
