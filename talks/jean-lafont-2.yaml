title: Comparing semi-norms on 3rd homology
abstract:  It follows from work of Crowley-Loeh (d>3) and Barge-Ghys (d=2) that in all degrees distinct from d=3, the l^1-seminorm and the manifold semi-norm coincide on homology of degree d. We show that when d=3, the two semi-norms are bi-Lipschitz to each other, with an explicitly computable constant. This was joint work with Christophe Pittet (Univ. Marseille).
