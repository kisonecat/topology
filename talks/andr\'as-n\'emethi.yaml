title: Lattice and Heegaard-Floer homologies of algebraic links
abstract: 'We compute the Heegaard-Floer link homology of algebraic links in terms
  of the multivariate Hilbert function of the corresponding plane curve singularities.
  A new version of lattice homology is defined: the lattice corresponds to the normalization
  of the singular germ, and the Hilbert function serves as the  weight function. The
  main result of the paper identifies four homologies: (a) the lattice homology associated
  with the Hilbert function, (b) the  homologies of the projectivized complements
  of local hyperplane arrangements cut out from the local algebra by valuations given
  by the  normalizations of irreducible components, (c) a certain variant of the Orlik--Solomon
  algebra of these local arrangements, and (d)  the Heegaard--Floer link homology
  of the local embedded link of the germ.   In particular, the Poincar\''e polynomials
  of all these homology groups are the same, and we also show that they agree with
  the coefficients of the motivic Poincar\''e  series of the singularity.'
