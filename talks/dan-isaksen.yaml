title: Sums-of-squares formulas and motivic cohomology
abstract: A sums-of-squares formula over a field $k$ is a polynomial identity of the
  form $\left( x_1^2 + \cdots + x_r^2 \right) \left( y_1^2 + \cdots + y_s^2 \right)
  = z_1^2 + \cdots z_t^2,$ where the $z$'s are bilinear in the $x$'s and $y$'s over
  $k$. If a sums-of-squares formula exists over $\mathbb{R}$, then a theorem of Hopf
  from 1940 gives numerical restrictions on $r$, $s$, and $t$. This result was one
  of the earliest uses of the cup product in singular cohomology.\nI will describe
  some joint work with D. Dugger on generalizing Hopf's result to arbitrary fields
  of characteristic not $2$.  The basic idea is to use motivic cohomology instead
  of singular cohomology.\nThis leads into the broader subject of computations in
  motivic homotopy theory.\nThis is a joint talk with algebraic geometry seminar.
