title: Chromatic convergence and its discontents
abstract: ' The chromatic convergence theorem of Ravenel and Hopkins asserts that,
  if $X$ is a $p$-local finite spectrum, then the homotopy limit $\text{holim}_n L_{E(n)}(X)$
  of the localizations of $X$ at each of the Johnson-Wilson $E$-theories $E(n)$ is
  homotopy-equivalent to $X$ itself. One way of seeing the chromatic convergence theorem
  is by regarding the functor sending a spectrum $X$ to $\text{holim}_n L_{E(n)}(X)$
  as a kind of completion, "chromatic completion," which has the agreeable property
  that $p$-local finite spectra are all already chromatic complete. Then there are
  two natural questions:\n1. Given a (not necessarily finite) spectrum $X$, is there
  a criterion that lets us decide easily whether $X$ is chromatically complete or
  not?\n2. Given a nonclassical setting for homotopy theory, such as equivariant spectra
  or motivic spectra, what analogue of the chromatic convergence theorem might hold?\nWe
  give an answers to each of these two questions. For a symmetric monoidal stable
  model category $C$ satisfying some reasonable hypotheses, we produce a natural notion
  of "chromatic completion," as well as the notion of a "chromatic cover," a commutative
  monoid object which shares important properties with the complex cobordism spectrum
  $MU$ from classical stable homotopy theory. We show that, if a chromatic cover exists
  in $C$, then any object $X$ satisfying Serre''s condition $S_n$ for any $n$ is chromatically
  complete if and only if the microlocal cohomology of $X$ vanishes. (Of course we
  have to define Serre''s condition $S_n$ as well as microlocal cohomology in this
  context!)\nWe get two important corollaries: first, by computing some microlocal
  cohomology groups, we find that large classes of non-finite classical spectra are
  not chromatically complete, such as the connective spectra $ku$ and $BP\langle n
  \rangle$ for all finite $n$. We also get some non-chromatic-completeness results
  for $\text{ko}$, $\text{tmf}$, and $\text{taf}$. Second, we get conditions under
  which a chromatic completion theorem can hold for motivic and equivariant spectra:
  one needs a chromatic cover to exist in those categories of spectra. We identify
  a candidate for such a chromatic cover for motivic spectra over $\text{Spec}\, C$,
  assuming the Dugger-Isaksen nilpotence conjecture.'
