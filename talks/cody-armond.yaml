title: The Tail of the Colored Jones Polynomial
abstract: The colored Jones polynomial is a sequence of knot invariants. For alternating and adequate knots, it can be shown that the sequence of leading coefficients will stabilize, which allows us to define a power series invariant called the tail of the colored Jones polynomial. We will discuss the definition of this power series as well as techniques to compute it for certain large classes of knots, and it's relation to the all-A state graph of a particular diagram of the knot.
