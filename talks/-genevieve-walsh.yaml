title: Boundaries of Kleinian groups
abstract: We consider hyperbolic groups with boundaries homeomorphic to the boundaries of certain types of Kleinian groups.   We show that a hyperbolic group quasi-isometric to a mixed Kleinian surface group is virtually a mixed Kleinian surface group.  Furthermore, in this case, the rigid pieces of the two groups are commensurable.  This is joint work with Peter Haissinsky and Luisa Paoluzzi.
