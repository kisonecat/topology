title: Aspherical manifolds obtained by gluing locally symmetric manifolds
abstract:  Aspherical manifolds are manifolds that have contractible universal covers. I will explain how to construct closed aspherical manifolds by gluing the Borel-Serre compactifications of locally symmetric spaces using the reflection group trick. I will also discuss rigidity aspects of these manifolds, such as whether a homotopy equivalence of such a manifold is homotopic to a homeomorphism.
