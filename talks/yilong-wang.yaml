title: Random Walk Invariants of String Links From R-matrices
abstract: We show that the exterior powers of the matrix valued random walk invariant of string links, introduced by Lin, Tian, and Wang, are isomorphic to the graded components of the tangle functor associated to the Alexander Polynomial by Ohtsuki divided by the zero graded invariant of the functor. Several resulting properties of these representations of the string link monoids are discussed. The talk is based on joint work with Thomas Kerler.
