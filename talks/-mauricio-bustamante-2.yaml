title: Smooth bundles with nonpositively curved fibers
abstract: I will discuss some features of the topology of smooth bundles whose fiber is a closed smooth manifold that supports a nonpositively curved Riemannian metric. Specifically, I will show (topological) rigidity results for the associated vertical tangent bundle and a vanishing theorem for the generalized Miller-Morita-Mumford classes. This is joint work with Tom Farrell and Yi Jiang.
