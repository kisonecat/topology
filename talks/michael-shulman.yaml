title: Spectral sequences in homotopy type theory
abstract: I will describe a method for constructing spectral sequences in homotopy type theory, including ones of Leray-Serre-type and Atiyah-Hirzebruch-type and possibly others.  This provides a good test case to discuss ways in which homotopy theory in type theory is similar to and different from classical algebraic topology.  I will mention some potential applications, both inside type theory and outside of it (by way of categorical semantics).  No prior knowledge of homotopy type theory will be necessary.
