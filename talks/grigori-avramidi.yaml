title: Flat tori in the homology of some locally symmetric spaces
abstract: I'll show that many finite covers of $\mathrm{SL}(m,Z)\backslash \mathrm{SL}(m,R)/\mathrm{SO}(m)$
  have non-trivial homology classes generated by totally geodesic flat $(m-1)$-tori.  This
  is joint work with Tam Nguyen Phan.
