title: Refinement of Betti (Novikov--Betti) numbers  and homology (Novikov--homology) provided by a real (angle vauled) map.
abstract: 'To any pair $(X,f)$, $X$ compact ANR and $f$ a real (angle) valued map
  defined on $X$ and any $r$, a non-negative integer, we assign: (1) a finite configuration
  of points ``$z$'''' with multiplicities $\delta_{rf}(z)$ located in the complex
  plane and (2) a finite configuration of vector spaces $\delta^{f} (z)$ indexed by
  the same $z$â€²s in analogy with (1) the configuration of eigenvalues and of (2) generalized
  eigenspaces of a linear operator in a finite dimensional complex vector space.\nThe
  analogy goes quite far as long as the formal properties are concerned and becomes
  particularly subtle in the case of an angle valued map (involving L-2 topology).
  The basic properties/implications are discussed.'
