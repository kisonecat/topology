title: Non-simply-connected rational surgery
abstract: We will generalize Sullivan's rational surgery realization theorem to the
  case when the fundamental group is finite; given a finite group action on a rational
  Poincar\'e duality algebra, does there exist a closed manifold realizing the algebra
  as its cohomology ring with the group acting freely on it?
