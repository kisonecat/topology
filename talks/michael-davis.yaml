title:  Hyperplane arrangement complements as posets of CW complexes.
abstract: The complement of an arrangement, $A$, of a finite number of affine hyperplanes
  in $\mathbf{C}^n$ is homotopy equivalent to a poset of CW complexes indexed by the
  intersection poset, $L(A)$.  The subcomplex corresponding to $G\in L(A)$ is homotopy
  equivalent to the complement of the central arrangement $A_G$ normal to $G$.  Similarly,
  toric hyperplane arrangements have the structure of a diagram of spaces. These structure
  can be used repair a spectral sequence argument in earlier papers by my collaborators
  and me on the cohomology of such complements with certain local coefficients.  This
  is joint work with Boris Okun.
