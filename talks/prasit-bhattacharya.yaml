title: On the spectrum that admits 1-periodic v_2-self-map at the prime 2
abstract: At the prime 2, Behrens-Hill-Hopkins-Mahowald showed $M(1,4)$ admits 32-periodic
  $v_2$-self-map and more recently B-Egger-Mahowald showed $A_1$ also admits 32-periodic
  $v_2$-self-map. This leads to the question, whether there exists a finite 2-local
  complex with periodicity less than 32. This talk will answer the question by producing
  a finite 2-local complex $Z$ which admits 1-periodic $v_2$-self-map. Apart from
  admitting 1-periodic $v_2$-self-map, Z has  other remarkable properties such as
  $tmf_\ast Z =k(2)_\ast$ and $E \wedge Z = K(2)  \wedge (G_48)_+$, where $E$ is the
  height 2 Morava $E$-theory and $G_{48}$ is the maximal profinite subgroup of Morava
  stabilizer group. This work is joint with P. Egger.
