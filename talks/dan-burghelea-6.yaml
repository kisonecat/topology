title: New topological invariants (bar codes and Jordan cell) at work (part I)
abstract: 'Bar codes and Jordan cells provide a new type of linear algebra invariants
  which can be used in topology. In joint work with Tamal Dey we have associated with
  any angle valued generic map $f : X \to S^1$, $X$ a compact nice space (ANR), $\kappa$
  any field and any integer $r$, $0 \leq r \leq \dim X$, a collection of such bar
  codes and Jordan cells. They can be effectively computed in case $\kappa = \mathbb{C}$
  or $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $X$ is a simplicial complex and f a simplicial map by algorithms
  implementable by familiar software (Matematica, Mapple or Matlab). In this lecture
  I will describe some joint work with S Haller.\n1. We prove that the Jordan cells
  defined using $f$ are homotopy invariants of the pair $(X,\xi)$, $\xi ∈ H^1(X;\mathbb{Z})$
  representing $f$. \n2. We calculate the homology $H_∗(\tilde{X};\kappa)$ as a $\kappa[t^{−1},t]$
  module, $\tilde{X}$ the infinite cyclic cover of $X$ induced by $\xi$, as well as
  and the Novikov homology and Milnor-Turaev torsion of $(X;\xi)$ in terms of bar
  codes and Jordan cells. \n3. As a consequence we introduce Lefchetz zeta function
  of a pair $(X;\xi)$ which generalizes the familiar Lefschetz zeta function of a
  self map of a compact manifold and the Alexander polynomial of a knot, and relate
  this function to dynamics.'
