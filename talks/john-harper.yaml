title: Completions in topology and homotopy theory
abstract: I will give a historical overview of completions in topology and homotopy theory starting with the work of D. Sullivan, together with motivation and applications of these constructions, including H.R. Miller's proof of the Sullivan conjecture and Mandell's "homotopical double dual" result for algebraically characterizing p-adic homotopy types. I will then describe a variation of these completion ideas for the enriched algebraic-topological context of homotopy theoretic commutative rings that arises naturally in algebraic K-theory, derived algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology. I will finish by describing some recent results on completion in this new context, which are joint with M. Ching.
