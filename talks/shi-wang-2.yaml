title: Simplicial volume of nonpositively curved manifolds
abstract: In this talk, I will discuss the notion of simplicial volume introduced by Gromov and Thurston. For nonpositively curved manifolds, Gromov conjectured that negative Ricci curvature implies postivitity of simplicial volume. I will talk about some recent work joint with Chris Connell. We show that, under a stronger curvature condition, the simplicial volume is always positive, this answers a special case of Gromov's problem.â€‹
