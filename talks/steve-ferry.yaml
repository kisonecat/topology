title: Volume Growth, DeRham Cohomology, and the Higson Compactification
abstract: We construct a variant of DeRham cohomology and use it to prove that the
  Higson compactification of $R^n$ has uncountably generated $n^{\mbox{th}}$ integral
  cohmology. We also explain that there is, nevertheless, a way of using the Higson
  compactification to prove the Novikov conjecture for a large class of groups.
