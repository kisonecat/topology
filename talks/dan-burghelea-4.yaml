title: Alexander Polynomial revisited
abstract: I will provide alternative definitions and methods of calculations for the Alexander Polynomial of a knot  and ultimately a generalization of this invariant to all odd dimensional manifolds with large fundamental group. The generalization is a "rational function" on the variety of complex rank K representations of the fundamental group.
