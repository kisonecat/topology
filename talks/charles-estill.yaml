title: 'Matroid Connection: Matroids for Algebraic Topology'
abstract: In our paper "Polynomial Invariants of Graphs on Surfaces" we found a relationship
  between two polynomials cellularly embedded in a surface, the Krushkal polynomial,
  based on the Tutte polynomial of a graph and using data from the algebraic topology
  of the graph and the surface, and the Las Vergnas polynomial for the matroid perspective
  from the bond matroid of the dual graph to the circuit matroid of the graph, $\mathcal{B}(G^\ast)
  \to \mathcal{C}(G)$.\nWith Vyacheslav Krushkal having (with D. Renardy) expanded
  his polynomial to the $n$th dimension of a simplicial or CW decomposition of a $2n$-dimensional
  manifold, a matroid perspective was found whose Las Vergnas polynomial would play
  a similar role to that in the 2-dimensional case.\nWe hope that these matroids and
  the perspective will prove useful in the study of complexes.
