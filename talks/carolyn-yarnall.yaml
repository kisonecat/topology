title: A new formulation of the slice filtration
photograph: carolyn-yarnall.jpg
abstract: A common theme in mathematics is to try to understand an object by breaking it down into smaller pieces via a filtration and then study how those pieces fit together. In (stable) homotopy theory, we use the Postnikov tower to filter a space (or spectrum) by its homotopy groups. In equivariant stable homotopy theory, the slice filtration is one object that plays the role of the Postnikov tower. In this talk, I will first recall the construction of the Postnikov tower, we will then discuss some basics of equivariant stable homotopy theory, and I will describe the construction of the slice tower, highlighting a new way to better understand how this object filters G-spectra.
