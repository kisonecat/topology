title: Random 2-bridge Chebyshev billiard table diagrams
abstract: Koseleff and Pecker show that all knots can be parametrized by Chebyshev
  polynomials in three dimensions. These long knots can be realized as trajectories
  on billiard table diagrams. We use this knot diagram model to study random knot
  diagrams by flipping a coin at each 4-valent vertex of the trajectory.\nWe truncate
  this model to study 2-bridge knots together with the unknot. We give the exact probability
  of a knot arising in this model.  Furthermore, we give the exact probability of
  obtaining a knot with crossing number c.\nThis is joint work with Sunder Ram Krishnan
  and Chaim Even-Zohar.
