title: Local duality in algebra and topology
abstract: Local cohomology was introduced by Grothendieck as a substitute in algebraic
  geometry for the relative cohomology of a pair of spaces. His studies culminate
  in his local duality theorem, a result that has proven to be important both computationally
  and conceptually. Subsequently, this theory has been extended in many directions,
  most notably by Greenlees and May with the introduction of local homology functors
  and their interpretation of local duality as special case of what is now know as
  Greenlees-May duality.\nHowever, local duality type results appear in other instances
  not covered by the existent theory. In this talk, we will introduce a common categorical
  framework that exhibits local duality as a fundamental phenomenon in different contexts.
  We will explain how this can be used to develop the theory for comodules over certain
  Hopf algebroids and their corresponding geometric interpretation as quasi-coherent
  sheaves over stacks. If time permits, we will show an application of this theory
  to the computation of certain cohomology theories in chromatic homotopy theory.  This
  is joint work with Tobias Barthel and Drew Heard.
