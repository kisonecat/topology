title: Real hyperbolic hyperplane complements in the complex hyperbolic plane
abstract: In the late 80's Gromov and Thurston constructed examples of manifolds which do not admit a hyperbolic metric but do admit metrics whose sectional curvature is pinched arbitrarily close to -1.  Their construction involves taking cyclic branched covers of hyperbolic manifolds over "nice" codimension two totally geodesic submanifolds.  In a joint project with J.F. Lafont, J. Meyer, and B. Tshishiku we have extended this construction to 4-manifolds whose metric is modeled on the complex hyperbolic plane.  This will be the content of the first half of the talk.\nFor this group project, I needed to understand the metric in the complex hyperbolic plane expressed in polar coordinates about a copy of the real hyperbolic plane.  This research will make up the second half of the talk.
