title: Explicit class field theory and stable homotopy groups of spheres
abstract: ' One knows from Artin reciprocity that, for any abelian Galois extension
  $L/K$ of $p$-adic number fields, there is an isomorphism $K^{\times} / N_{L/K} L^{\times}
  \to  Gal(L/K)$ from the units in $K$ modulo the norms of units in $L$ to the Galois
  group of $L/K$; this isomorphism is called the "norm residue symbol." Computing
  the norm residue symbol explicitly on specific elements of its domain is quite difficult
  and is an open area of research in algebraic number theory.\nGiven an abelian Galois
  extension $L$ of $Q_p$ and a finite CW-complex $X$, we use Lubin-Tate theory and
  the Goerss-Hopkins-Miller theorem to produce a particular subgroup of the $K(1)$-local
  stable homotopy groups of $X$. We show that this construction provides a filtration,
  indexed by the abelian extensions of $Q_p$, of the $K(1)$-local stable homotopy
  groups of finite CW-complexes, and we use Dwork''s computation of the norm residue
  symbol on the maximal abelian extension of $Q_p$ to compute this filtration explicitly
  on some interesting finite CW-complexes, such as mod $p$ Moore spaces. We then use
  the nilpotence and localization theorems of Ravenel-Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith to produce
  a "dictionary" that lets us pass between norm residue symbols computations from
  explicit class field theory, and families of nilpotent elements in the $K(1)$-local
  stable homotopy groups of finite ring spectra.\nTime allowing, we will discuss what
  versions of a (so far only conjectural) $p$-adic Langlands correspondence would
  permit these methods to be extended to higher heights, i.e., $K(n)$-local stable
  homotopy groups and nonabelian Galois extensions of $Q_p$.'
