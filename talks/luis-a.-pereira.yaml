title: Calculus of algebras over a spectral operad
abstract: 'The overall goal of this talk is to apply the theory of Goodwillie calculus
  to the category $\mathrm{Alg}_O$ of algebras over a spectral operad. Its first part
  will deal with generalizing many of the original results of Goodwillie so that they
  apply to a larger class of model categories and hence be applicable to $\mathrm{Alg}_O$.
  The second part will apply that generalized theory to the $\mathrm{Alg}_O$ categories.
  The main results here are: an understanding of finitary homogeneous functors between
  such categories; identifying the Taylor tower of the identity in those categories;
  showing that finitary n-excisive functors can not distinguish between $\mathrm{Alg}_O$
  and $\mathrm{Alg}_{O \leq n}$, the category of algebras over the truncated $O \neq
  n$; and a weak form of the chain rule between such algebra categories, analogous
  to the one studied by Arone and Ching in the case of Spaces and Spectra.'
