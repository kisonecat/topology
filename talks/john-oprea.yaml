title: LS category, the fundamental group and Bochner-type estimates
abstract: The LS category of a space X is a numerical invariant that measures the complexity of a space. While it is usually very hard to compute explicitly, there are estimates and approximating invariants that help us to understand category better. A big problem is to understand the effect of the fundamental group on category. Recently, extending work of Dranishnikov, Jeff Strom and the speaker have given an upper bound for category using Ralph Fox's 1-category (and another approximating invariant). Using an interpretation of this 1-category given by Svarc, we have also been able to refine Bochner's bound on the first Betti number in the presence of non-negative Ricci curvature. Finally, the 1-category forms a bridge between the theorems of Yamaguchi and Kapovitch-Petrunin-Tuschmann on manifolds with almost non-negative sectional curvature.
