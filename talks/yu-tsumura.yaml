title: A 2-categorical extension of the Reshetikhin-Turaev topological quantum field theory
abstract: The Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFT is a functor from a category of 3-dimensional cobordisms to the category of vector spaces. To include surfaces with boundaries and cobordisms with corners in the RT TQFT setting, I will discuss a concrete construction of a 2-categorical extension of the RT TQFT. This extension is a 2-functor from a 2-category of cobordisms with corners to the Kapranov-Voevodsky 2-vector spaces.
