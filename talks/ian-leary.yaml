title: Platonic triangle complexes
abstract: I will discuss work arising from Raciel Valle's thesis concerning complexes built from triangles that are highly symmetrical and have vertex links the join of $n$ pairs of points (equivalently the $1$-skeleton of the $n$-dimensional analogue of the octahedron).
