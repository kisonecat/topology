title: Fundamental Theorems for the $K$-theory of $S$-algebras
abstract: " We show how recent results of Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy can be used to
  give efficient proofs of i) a Fundamental Theorem for the K-theory of connective
  S-algebras, ii) an integral localization theorem for the relative K-theory of a
  1-connected map of connective S-algebras, iii) a generalized localization  theorem
  for the p-complete relative K-theory of a 1-connected map of connective S-algebras.
  Following Weibel, we define homotopy K-theory for general S-algebras, and prove
  that the corresponding NK-groups of the sphere spectrum are non-trivial.\\nMuch
  of this work arose in an attempt to apply recent results and methods from topological
  cyclic homology to update Waldhausen's original program for studying the effect
  of Ravenel's chromatic tower on the algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum. We
  will give a brief summary of this program, along with recent results of Blumberg-Mandell
  and how they fit into some deep conjectures of Rognes. As time permits, we will
  add some conjectures to the list."
