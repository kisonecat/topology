title: Random graph products of groups
abstract:  There is a theory of random graphs due to Erdos and Renyi. Associated to any group and a graph there is a notion of its graph product.  So, there also is a notion of a random graph products of groups.  For example, by letting the group be Z/2, the graph product can be any right-angled Coxeter group.  We compute the cohomological invariants of random graph products.  This is joint work with Matt Kahle.
