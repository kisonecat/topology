title:  Barycentric straightening and bounded cohomology.
abstract: In this talk, I will report on joint work with Jean Lafont. We show that,
  for an $n$-dimensional irreducible symmetric space of rank $r\geq 2$ (excluding
  $SL(3,\mathbb R)/SO(3)$ and $SL(4, \mathbb R)/SO(4)$), the $p$-Jacobian of barycentrically
  straightened simplices has uniformly bounded norm, provided $p\geq n-r+2$. As a
  consequence, for the corresponding non-compact, connected, semisimple real Lie group
  $G$, every degree $p$ cohomology class has a bounded representative. This answers
  Dupont's problem in small codimension. We also give examples of symmetric spaces
  where the barycentrically straightened simplices of dimension $n-r$ have unbounded
  volume, showing that the range in which we obtain boundedness of the $p$-Jacobian
  is very close to optimal. I will also discuss some of my recent work on its generalization.
