title: On volumes of compact anti-de Sitter 3-manifolds
abstract: Anti de-Sitter manifolds are Lorentzian manifolds with constant curvature $-1$.  In a loose analogy with Teichmuller space, there is a moduli space of AdS 3-manifolds with a given fundamental group.  This space is not entirely understood---for instance, we do not know how many connected components it has---but we do know a fair amount.  We know much less about how the geometry of the manifolds varies across the moduli space.  I'll present the some preliminary results on how volume varies across the moduli space and state a few questions the results so far raise.
