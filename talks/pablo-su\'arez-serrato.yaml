title: Using 4-manifolds to describe groups
abstract: We will describe decompositions of finitely presented groups, using descriptions of smooth and of symplectic four-manifolds. Every finitely presented group admits a decomposition into a triple consisting of the fundamental groups of two compact complex KÃ¤hler surfaces with boundary and the fundamental group of a three manifold. We will exhibit various ways of obtaining similar decompositions of finitely presented groups into graphs, via descriptions of smooth 4-manifolds into Lefschetz fibrations. We distill this data into invariants, by considering the minimal number of edges these graphs may have. These ideas are related to the minimal euler characteristic of symplectic four-manifolds and the minimal genus of a Lefschetz fibration, seen as group invariants.
