title: The geometry and conservation laws of scalar parabolic differential equations
abstract: I will discuss the geometry of the class of second-order partial differential equations of parabolic type. In particular, any scalar parabolic differential equation is equivalent to a certain smooth manifold with extra geometric structure. This geometric structure has local invariants that control the behavior of solutions, as well as various properties of the equation itself. I will also explain what a good understanding of these local invariants tells us about the conservation laws of parabolic differential equations.
