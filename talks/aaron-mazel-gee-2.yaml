title: Goerss--Hopkins obstruction theory for $\infty$-categories
abstract: Goerss--Hopkins obstruction theory is a tool for obtaining structured ring
  spectra from algebraic data. It was originally conceived as the main ingredient
  in the construction of \textit{tmf}, although it's since become useful in a number
  of other settings, for instance in setting up a tractable theory of spectral algebraic
  geometry and in Rognes's Galois correspondence for commutative ring spectra. In
  this talk, I'll give some background, explain in broad strokes how the obstruction
  theory is built, and then indicate how one might go about generalizing it to an
  arbitrary (presentable) $\infty$-category. This last part relies on the notion of
  a \textit{model $\infty$-category} -- that is, of an $\infty$-category equipped
  with a ``model structure'' -- which provides a theory of resolutions internal to
  $\infty$-categories and which will hopefully prove to be of independent interest.
