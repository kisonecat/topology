title: Aspherical products which do not support Anosov diffeomorphisms
abstract: We show that the product of infranilmanifolds with certain aspherical closed manifolds do not support Anosov diffeomorphisms. As a special case, we obtain that products of a nilmanifold and negatively curved manifolds of dimension at least three do not support Anosov diffeomorphisms.  This is joint work with Andrey Gogolev (Binghamton).
