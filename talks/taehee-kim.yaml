title: Concordance of knots and Seifert forms
abstract: Two knots in the 3-sphere are said to be concordant if they cobound a locally flat, properly embedded annulus in the product of the 3-sphere and the unit interval. The notion of concordance originates from Fox and Milnor, and it is related with other 3- and 4-dimensional topological properties such as homology cobordism and topological surgery theory. In this talk, I will discuss various relationships between concordance and Seifert forms (or the Alexander polynomial) of knots. In particular, I will explain Cha-Orr's extension of Cochran-Orr-Teichner's concordance invariants, which are von Neumann rho-invariants, and show its application to this subject.
