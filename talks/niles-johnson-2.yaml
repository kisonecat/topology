title: Obstruction theory for homotopical algebra maps
abstract: We take an obstruction-theoretic approach to the question of algebraic structure
  in homotopical settings.  At its heart, this is an application of the Bousfield-Kan
  spectral sequence adapted for the action of a monad T on a topological model category.\nThis
  talk will focus on the special case where T is a monad encoding E_infty structure
  in spectra and H_infty structure in the derived category of spectra.  We will present
  examples from rational homotopy theory illustrating the obstructions to rigidifying
  homotopy algebra maps to strict algebra maps, and explain in a precise way how the
  edge homomorphism of this obstruction spectral sequence measures the difference
  between up-to-homotopy and on-the-nose T-algebra maps.
