title: The lower algebraic $K$-theory of three-dimensional crystallographic groups
abstract: In this joint work with Daniel Farley, we compute the lower algebraic $K$-groups of all split three-dimensional crystallographic groups $G$. These groups account for 73 isomorphism types of three-dimensional crystallographic groups, out of 219 types in all. Alves and Ontaneda  in 2006, gave a simple formula for the Whitehead group of a 3-dimensional crystallographic group $G$ in terms of the Whitehead groups of the virtually infinite cyclic subgroups of $G$. The main goal in this work in progress is to obtain explicit computations for $K_0(ZG)$ and $K_{-1}(ZG)$ for these groups.
