title: Categorical models in homotopy theory
abstract: This will be a survey-style talk describing ways that categorical algebra helps us understand calculations in homotopy theory.  Our main result is the 2-dimensional Stable Homotopy Hypothesis; we will explain what this means and how it relates to basic questions in topology and basic tools in algebra.  We will close with some indications of the crucial technical results and what they have taught us about higher-dimensional categories.  Much of the talk is based on joint work with Nick Gurski, Ang√©lica Osorno, and Marc Stephan.
