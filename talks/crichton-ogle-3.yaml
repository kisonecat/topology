title: Hermitian K-theory of Spaces 
abstract: A fundamental question (still unanswered) is whether certain ``periodic''
  functors on the category of discrete groups, such as the topological $K$-theory
  of $C^*(\pi)$ or the Witt theory of $\mathbb Z[\pi]$, can be extended to a functors
  on the category of basepointed topological spaces which depend (rationally) on more
  than just the fundamental group. Following earlier work of Burghelea-Fiedorowicz,
  Fiedorowicz-Vogt, and Vogell, I will propose a model for a functor $X\mapsto AH(X)$,
  which may be thought of as an Hermitian analogue of Waldhausen's functor $X\mapsto
  A(X)$, and occurs as the $\mathbb Z/2$ fixed-point set of an involution defined
  on a certain model of $A(X)$. I will also explain how a suitable $\mathbb Z/2$-equivariant
  version of Waldhausen's splitting $Q(X_+)\to A(X)\to Q(X_+)$ verifies the Novikov
  conjecture for $\pi_1(X)$.
