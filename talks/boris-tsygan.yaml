title: Algebraic structures on Hochschild and cyclic complexes
abstract: The Hochschild chain and cochain complexes and the cyclic complex of an associative algebra serve as noncommutative analogs of classical geometric objects on a manifold, such as differential forms and multivector fields. These complexes are known to possess a very nontrivial and rich algebraic structure that is analogous to, and goes well beyond, the classical algebraic structures known in geometry. In this talk, I will give a review of the subject and outline an approach that is based on an observation that differential graded categories form a two-category up to homotopy.
