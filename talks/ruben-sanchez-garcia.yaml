title: Classifying spaces and the Isomorphism Conjectures
abstract: 'For each discrete group G one can find a universal G-space with stabilizers
  in a prescribed family of subgroups of G. These spaces play a prominent role in
  the so-called Isomorphism Conjectures, namely the Baum-Connes and the Farrell-Jones
  conjectures. We will discuss the former conjecture in more detail and describe its
  topological side: the equivariant K-homology of the universal space for proper actions.
  Finally, we will report on joint work with Jean-Fran√ßois Lafont and Ivonne Ortiz
  on the rationalized topological side for some low dimensional groups.'
