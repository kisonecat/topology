title: 'Volume distortion in homotopy groups: a safari'
abstract: 'Given a metric on a finite CW-complex $X$, how can we use geometry to better
  understand elements $\alpha \in \pi_n(X)$?  One way is by measuring distortion,
  that is, the way the geometric complexity of an optimal representative of $k\alpha$
  grows as a function of $k$. In some sense, the "true" measure of complexity is given
  by the Lipschitz constant, but volume provides an upper bound which is interesting
  in many cases.  Compared with Lipschitz distortion, which is the topic of an as
  yet unresolved conjecture of Gromov, volume distortion is tractable and satisfies
  a strong form of topological invariance.  I will present examples of three ways
  that volume distortion can arise: from rational homotopy invariants, from the action
  of the fundamental group on higher homotopy groups, and from the geometry of the
  fundamental group. These three sources of distortion turn out to be enough to characterize
  those spaces which have no distorted elements.'
