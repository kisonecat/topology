title: Riemannian vs. metric non-positive curvature on 4-manifolds
abstract:  I'll outline the construction of smooth 4-manifolds which support locally CAT(0)-metrics (the metric version of non-positive curvature), but do not support any Riemannian metric of non-positive sectional curvature. This is joint work with Mike Davis and Tadeusz Januszkiewicz.
