title: On group actions on $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$-spaces and the Farrell-Jones Isomorphism
  Conjecture.
abstract: The Farrell-Jones isomorphism conjecture (FJIC) plays an important role
  in manifold topology as well as computations in algebraic $K$- and $L$-theory. It
  implies, for example, the Borel conjecture of topological rigidity of closed aspherical
  manifolds and the Novikov conjecture of homotopy invariance of higher signatures.  By
  the work of A. Bartels, W. Lueck and C. Wegner, it's now known that FJIC holds for
  $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$-groups, i.e. groups admitting proper, cocompact actions on finite
  dimensional proper $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$-spaces. This includes for example fundamental
  groups of nonpositively curved  closed Riemannian manifolds. It's a natural question
  that if a group admits a "nice" but not necessary proper action on a $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$-space
  and if the point stabilizers satisfy FJIC, whether the original group satisfies
  FJIC. In this talk, after outlining the general strategy for proving FJIC,  I will
  talk about the progress that I have made concerning the above question.
