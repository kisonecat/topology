title: Smith Theory
abstract: " P.A. Smith, in the first half of the 20th century, developed homological
  tools to study actions of finite p-groups on topological spaces.  The standard applications
  of Smith theory are that if a p-group acts on a {disk, sphere, manifold, finite-dimensional
  space} then the fixed set of the action is a {mod p homology disk, mod p homology
  sphere, mod p homology manifold, finite dimensional space}.\\nThis talk will review
  the classical theory, give applications to actions on aspherical manifolds, and
  extend the theory to give restrictions on periodic knots."
