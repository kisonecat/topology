title: A (computer friendly) alternative to Morse-Novikov theory
abstract: We present an alternative to Morse-Novikov theory which  works for a considerably larger class of spaces and maps rather than smooth manifolds and Morse maps.  One explains  what Morse-Novikov  theory does for dynamics and topology  and indicates how our theory does almost the same for a considerably larger class of situations as well as its additional features.
