title: Non-nilpotent elements in motivic homotopy theory
abstract: 'Classically, the nilpotence theorem of Devinatz, Hopkins, and Smith tells
  us that non-nilpotent self maps on finite $p$-local spectra induce nonzero homomorphisms
  on $\mathrm{BP}$-homology. Motivically, this theorem fails to hold: we have a motivic
  analog of $\mathrm{BP}$ and whilst $\eta:S^{1,1}\to S^{0,0}$ induces zero on $\mathrm{BP}$-homology,
  it is non-nilpotent. Recent work with Haynes Miller has led to a computation of
  $\eta^{-1}\pi_{*,*}(S^{0,0})$; we found it to have a very simple description.\nI''ll
  introduce the motivic homotopy category and the motivic Adams-Novikov spectral sequence
  before describing this theorem. Then I''ll talk about the fact that there are more
  periodicity operators in chromatic motivic homotopy theory than in the classical
  story. In particular, I will describe a new non-nilpotent self map.'
