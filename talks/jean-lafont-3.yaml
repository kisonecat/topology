title: Vanishing simplicial volume for certain affine manifolds
abstract: We show that closed aspherical manifolds supporting an affine structure, whose holonomy map is injective and contains a pure translation, must have vanishing simplicial volume. As a consequence, we verify the Chern Conjecture for complete affine manifolds whose holonomy contains a pure translation. This is joint work with Michelle Bucher (Geneva) and Chris Connell (Indiana).
