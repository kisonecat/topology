title: Relative Property A and Relative Amenability
abstract: " We define the notion of a group having relative property A with respect
  to a finite family of subgroups. Many characterizations for relative  property A
  are given.  In particular a cohomological characterization  shows that if $G$ has
  property A relative to a family of subgroups  $\\mathcal{H}$, and if each $H \\in
  \\mathcal{H}$ has property A, then $G$  has property A. This result leads to new
  classes of groups that have  property A.  Specializing the definition of relative
  property A, an  analogue definition of relative amenability for discrete groups
  are  introduced and similar results are obtained."
