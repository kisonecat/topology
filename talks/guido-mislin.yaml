title: Borel cohomology and large-scale geometry in Lie groups
abstract: The Borel cohomology groups $H_B^\star(G, \mathbb{Z})$ of a Lie group $G$
  are based on cocycles, which are Borel maps. These Borel cohomology groups are known
  to be naturally isomorphic to the singular cohomology groups $H^\star(BG,\mathbb{Z})$
  of the classifying space $BG$ of $G$, the domain of primary characteristic classes.
  We discuss the relationship between boundedness properties of cocycles in $H_B^\star(G,
  \mathbb{Z})$ and subgroup distortion in $G$ (joint work with Indira Chatterji, Yves
  de Cornulier and Christophe Pittet).
