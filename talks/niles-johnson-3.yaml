title: Complex Orientations and p-typicality
abstract: This talk will describe computational results related to the structure of
  power operations on complex oriented cohomology theories (localized at a prime $p$),
  making use of the amazing connection between complex orientations and the theory
  of formal group laws. After introducing the relevant concepts, we will describe
  results from joint work with Justin Noel showing that, for primes $p$ less than
  or equal to 13, orientations factoring non-trivially through the Brown-Peterson
  spectrum cannot carry power operations, and thus cannot provide $MU_{(p)}$-algebra
  structure. This implies, for example, that if E is a Landweber exact $MU_{(p)}$-ring
  whose associated formal group law is $p$-typical of positive height, then the canonical
  map $\mathrm{MU}_{(p)} \to E$ is not a map of $H_\infty$ ring spectra. It immediately
  follows that the standard $p$-typical orientations on $\mathrm{BP}$, $E(n)$, and
  $E_n$ do not rigidify to maps of $E_\infty$ ring spectra. We conjecture that similar
  results hold for all primes.
