title: Farrell-Jones conjecture for Baumslag-Solitar groups
abstract: The Baumslag-Solitar groups are a particular class of two-generator one-relation groups which have played a surprisingly useful role in combinatorial and geometric group theory. They have provided examples which mark boundaries between different classes of groups and they often provide a test-cases for theories and techniques. In this talk, I will illustrate the proof of the Farrell-Jones conjecture for them. This is a joint work with my advisor Tom Farrell.
