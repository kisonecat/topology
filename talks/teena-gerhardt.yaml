title: Computations in algebraic K-theory
abstract: 'Algebraic K-theory brings together classical invariants of rings with homotopy groups of topological spaces. In general algebraic K-theory groups are difficult to compute, but in recent years methodsin equivariant stable homotopy theory have led to many important K-theory computations. I will introduce this approach to K-theory computations, and discuss why it is particularly useful in studying the algebraic K-theory of pointed monoid algebras. I will also present some of my recent joint work with Angeltveit on the algebraic K-theory of the group ring $\mathbb{Z}[C_2]$.'
