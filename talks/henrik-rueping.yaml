title: The Farrell-Jones conjecture and bicombings
abstract: A Lot of topological obstructions live in the K-theory of Group rings. The Farrell-Jones conjecture makes predictions about that K-theory. Bartels and Lueck showed to Farrell-Jones conjecture for Groups Acting geometrically on CAT0-spaces. In Joint work with D.Kasprowski we generalized their work to Groups that act geometrically on spaces with certain bicombings. There are non-CAT0 groups which satisfy our assumptions. I will give some examples and finish by mentioning some open Problems.
