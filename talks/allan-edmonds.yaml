title: Introduction to Haken $n$-manifolds
abstract: Haken $n$-manifolds have recently been defined and studied by B. Foozwell and H. Rubinstein in analogy with the classical Haken manifolds of dimension 3, using the the theory of boundary patterns developed by K. Johannson. They can be systematically cut apart along essential codimension-one hypersurfaces until one obtains a system of $n$-cells with a boundary pattern recording some of the information carried by the original manifold and the cutting hypersurfaces. Haken manfolds in all dimensions are aspherical and, in general are amenable to proofs by induction on the length of a hierarchy (and on dimension). As such they provide a a context to explore the classical Euler characteristic conjecture for closed aspherical manifolds, which we are doing in some joint work with M. Davis.
