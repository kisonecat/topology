title: The homotopy theory of cyclotomic spectra
abstract: In joint work with Andrew Blumberg, we construct a category of cyclotomic spectra that is (something like) a closed model category and which has well-behaved mapping spectra.  We show that topological cyclic homology (TC) is the corepresentable functor on this category given by maps out of the sphere spectrum, verifying a conjecture of Kaledin.
