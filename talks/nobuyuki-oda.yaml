title: Brown-Booth-Tillotson products and exponentiable spaces
abstract: To study the exponential law for function spaces with the compact-open topology,
  R. Brown introduced a topology for product set, which is finer than the product
  topology, and showed the exponential law for any Hausdorff spaces. The method was
  improved by P. Booth and J. Tillotson, making use of test maps, and they removed
  the Hausdorff condition for spaces. The product space they used is called the BBT-product.
  If we use any class of exponentiable spaces, then we can define a topology for function
  spaces which enables us to prove the exponential law  with the BBT-product for any
  spaces. We can apply the result to based spaces and we get various good results
  for homotopy theory. For example, we can prove a theorem of pairings of function
  spaces without imposing conditions on spaces and base points. If we look at the
  techniques carefully, we find that the results can also be applied to study group
  actions on function spaces.\nThe BBT-product is asymmetric in general and we can
  define the `centralizer' of the BBT-product, which contains the class of k-spaces
  defined by the class. The centralizer of the BBT-product has good properties for
  homotopy theory.\nThis talk is based on joint work with Yasumasa Hirashima.
