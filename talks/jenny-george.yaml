title: TQFTs from Quasi-Hopf Algebras and Group Cocycles
abstract: The original Hennings TQFT is defined for quasitriangular Hopf algebras satisfying various nondegeneracy requirements.  We extend this construction to quasitriangular quasi-Hopf algebras with related nondegeneracy conditions and prove that this new ``quasi-Hennings'' algorithm is well-defined and gives rise to TQFTs.  The ultimate goal is to apply this construction to the Dijkgraaf-Pasquier-Roche twisted double of the group algebra, and then show that the resulting TQFT is equivalent to a more geometric one, described by Freed and Quinn.
