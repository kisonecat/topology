title: Polynomials of graphs on surfaces
abstract: The Jones polynomial of links in 3-space is a specialization of the Tutte
  polynomial of corresponding plane graphs. There are several generalizations of the
  Tutte polynomial to graphs embedded into a surface. Some of them are related to
  the theory of virtual links. Although virtual link theory predicts some relations
  between these generalizations. I will report about the results obtained in this
  direction during my summer program "Knots and Graphs".\nIn particular I will compare
  three polynomials of graphs on surfaces and a relative version of the Tutte polynomial
  of planar graphs. The first polynomial, defined by M.Las Vergnas, uses a strong
  map of the bond matroid of the dual graph to the circuit matroid of the original
  graph. The second polynomial is the Bollobas-Riordan polynomial of a ribbon graph,
  a straightforward generalization of the Tutte polynomial. The third polynomial,
  due V.Krushkal, is defined using the symplectic structure in the first homology
  group of the surface.
