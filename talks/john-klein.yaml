title: Bundle structures and Algebraic $K$-theory
abstract: This talk will describe (Waldhausen type) algebraic $K$-theoretic obstructions to lifting fibrations to fiber bundles having compact smooth/topological manifold fibers. The surprise will be that a lift can often be found in the topological case. Examples will be given realizing the obstructions.
