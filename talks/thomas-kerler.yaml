title: Faithful Representations of the Braid Groups via Quantum Groups
abstract: In the last couple of decades the study of representations of braid  groups
  $B_n$ attracted attention from two rather different motivations. One deals with
  the linearity of the braid groups, that is, whether the $B_n$ can be faithfully
  represented.\nThis question was answered in the positive for the Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow
  (LKB) representation independently by Krammer and Bigelow around 2001. The LKB representation
  is given by the natural action of $B_n$ in the second homology of a rank two free
  abelian cover of the two-point configuration space on the $n$-punctured disc. It
  is thus naturally a module over the ring of Laurent polynomials in two variables.\nThe
  other development is the construction of braid representations from quantum groups.
  One such class of $B_n$-representations of is constructed using quantum-$sl_2$,
  which is a one-parameter Hopf algebra deformation of the universal enveloping algebra
  of $sl_2$. The algebra admits a quasi-triangular R-matrix which can be used to represent
  $B_n$ on the $n$-fold tensor product of a Verma module with generic highest weight.\nWe
  prove that the latter representation, with some refinement of the ground ring, is
  isomorphic to the LKB representation where the two parameters corresponding to the
  generators of the Deck transformation group are identified with the deformation
  parameter of quantum-$sl_2$ and  the generic highest  weight of the Verma module
  respectively. We also show irreducibility of this representation over the fraction
  field of the ring of Laurent polynomials.\n Time permitting we will discuss relations
  to other types of braid group representations that may shed light on this curious
  connection, as well as reducibility issues at certain choices of parameters.\nJoint
  work with Craig Jackson.
