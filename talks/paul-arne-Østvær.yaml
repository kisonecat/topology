title: Motivic slices and the graded Witt ring
abstract: We compute the motivic slices of hermitian K-theory and higher Witt-theory. The corresponding slice spectral sequences relate motivic cohomology to Hermitian K-groups and Witt groups, respectively. Using this we compute the Hermitian K-groups of number fields, and (re)prove Milnor's conjecture on quadratic forms for fields of characteristic different from 2. Joint work with Oliver Röndigs.
