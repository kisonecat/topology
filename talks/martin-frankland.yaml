title: Moduli spaces of 2-stage Postnikov systems
abstract: 'It is a classic fact that any graded group (abelian above dimension 1)
  can be realized as the homotopy groups of a space. However, the question becomes
  difficult if one includes the data of primary homotopy operations, known as a Pi-algebra.
  When a Pi-algebra is realizable, we would also like to classify all homotopy types
  that realize it.\nUsing an obstruction theory of Blanc-Dwyer-Goerss, we will describe
  the moduli space of realizations of certain 2-stage Pi-algebras. This is better
  than a classification: The moduli space provides information about realizations
  as well as their higher automorphisms.'
