title: Complete classification of generalized crossing changes between Genus One Fibered Knots
abstract: 'I will define and discuss Genus One Fibered Knots (GOF-knots), and a beautiful method to analyze them that touches on automorphisms of trees, representations of SL(2, Z), and hyperbolic geometry. I will then discuss how this analysis can be used to classify all monodromies of GOF-knots, the ambient manifolds in which they sit, and all generalized crossing changes from one GOF-knot to another within a manifold.'
