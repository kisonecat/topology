title: Wrinkled fibrations for 4-manifolds
abstract: (This is joint work with David Gay) I will discuss the existence and uniqueness theorems for wrinkled fibrations of arbitrary orientable, smooth $n$-manifolds ($n=4$ is the most interesting case) over orientable surfaces.  Existence sometimes holds, and there is a natural set of moves relating different wrinkled fibrations for a given $n$-manifold.  A wrinkled fibration is one in which the rank of the differential is 2 or is a curve of points of rank 1 which look locally like an arc cross an indefinite $k$-handle (and the curve is the arc cross the critical point of the k-handle).  Furthermore, fibers are always connected.
