title: Duality properties for abelian covers
abstract: 'In parallel with a classical definition due to Bieri and Eckmann, say an
  FP group G is an abelian duality group if H^p(G,Z[G^{ab}]) is zero except for a
  single integer p=n, in which case the cohomology group is torsion-free.  We make
  an analogous definition for spaces.  In contrast to the classical notion, the abelian
  duality property imposes some obvious constraints on the Betti numbers of abelian
  covers.\nWhile related, the two notions are inequivalent: for example, surface groups
  of genus at least 2 are (Poincar√©) duality groups, yet they are not abelian duality
  groups. On the other hand, using a result of Brady and Meier, we find that right-angled
  Artin groups are abelian duality groups if and only if they are duality groups:
  both properties are equivalent to the Cohen-Macaulay property for the presentation
  graph.  Building on work of Davis, Januszkiewicz, Leary and Okun, hyperplane arrangement
  complements are both duality and abelian duality spaces.  These results follow from
  a slightly more general, cohomological vanishing theorem, part of work in progress
  with Alex Suciu and Sergey Yuzvinsky.'
