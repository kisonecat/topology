title: Riemannian manifolds with local symmetry
abstract: In this talk I will discuss the problem of classifying all closed Riemannian manifolds whose universal cover has nondiscrete isometry group. Farb and Weinberger solved this under the assumption that $M$ is aspherical. Roughly, they proved that any such $M$ is a fiber bundle with locally homogeneous fibers. However, if $M$ is not aspherical, many new examples and phenomena appear. I will exhibit some of these, and discuss progress towards a classification. As an application, I will characterize simply-connected manifolds with both a compact and a noncompact finite volume quotient.
