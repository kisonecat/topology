title: Amenability and Property A
abstract:  We discuss Yu's property A as a generalization of amenability for countable groups.  A few characterizations of amenability and property A are given, including Johnson's cohomological characterization of amenability and the recent work of Brodzki, Nowak, Niblo, and Wright which characterizes property A in a similar manner. These characterizations play a major role in the relative versions of these properties.
