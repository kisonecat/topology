title: Homotopy and Reality
abstract: The Galois action of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ on the field of complex numbers plays
  prominent role in algebraic topology. Its significance in various contexts was discovered
  by Atiyah (in $K$-theory), Karoubi (Hermitian $K$-theory) and Landweber (real cobordism
  MR). It also played an important role in the development of equivariant stable homotopy
  theory by Araki, Adams, May and others. In 1998, Po Hu and I did extensive work
  on MR, including a complete calculation of its coefficients, and development of
  what we called Real homotopy theory. Our work was discovered 10 years later by Hill,
  Hopkins and Ravenel, and played a central role in their recent solution of the Kervaire
  invariant 1 problem. Meanwhile, there is a baffling parallel between Real and motivic
  homotopy theory which was used by Morel and Voevodsky, Levine and others in their
  investigation of algebraic cobordism. Recently, Hu,Ormsby and myself combined Real
  and algebraic techniques in a solution of the homotopy completion problem for Hermitian
  K-theory for fields of characteristic 0. I hope to touch on the different aspects
  of this amazing story in my talk.
