title: Some structural results for Farrell's twisted Nil-groups
abstract: Farrell Nil-groups are generalizations of Bass Nil-groups to the twisted case. They mainly play role in (1) The twisted version of the Fundamental theorem of algebraic K-Theory (2) Algebraic K-theory of group rings of virtually cyclic groups (3) as the obstruction to reduce the family of virtually cyclic groups used in the Farrell-Jones conjecture to the family of finite groups. These groups are quite mysterious. Farrell proved in 1977 that Bass Nil-groups are either trivial or infinitely generated in lower dimensions. Recently, we extended Farrellâ€™s result to the twisted case in all dimensions. We indeed derived some structural results for general Farrell Nil-groups. As a consequence, a structure theorem for an important class of Farrell Nil-groups is obtained. This is a joint work with Jean Lafont and Stratos Prassidis.
