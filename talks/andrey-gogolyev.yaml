title: Surgery constructions in partially hyperbolic dynamics, I
abstract: 'In the first lecture I will recall some background in hyperbolic dynamics and discuss several well-known open classification problems. In the second lecture I will explain certain cut-and-paste constructions which produce new higher dimensional examples of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms and flows. I plan to make both talks very accessible, especially the first one.
