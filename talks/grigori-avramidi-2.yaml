title: Isometries of aspherical manifolds
abstract: I will describe some recent results on isometry groups of aspherical Riemannian
  manifolds and their universal covers. The general theme is that topological properties
  of an aspherical manifold often restrict the isometries of an arbitrary complete
  Riemannian metric on that manifold. These topological properties  tend to be established
  by using a specific "nice" metric on the manifold.\nI will illustrate this by explaining
  why on an irreducible locally symmetric manifold, no metric has more symmetry than
  the locally symmetric metric. I will also discuss why moduli space is a minimal
  orbifold and relate this phenomenon to symmetries of arbitrary metrics on moduli
  space.
