title: Group actions and compact Clifford-Klein forms of homogeneous spaces
abstract: " A compact Clifford-Klein form of the homogeneous space $J\\backslash H$
  is a compact manifold $J\\backslash H/\\Gamma$ constructed using a discrete subgroup
  $\\Gamma$ of $H$. I will survey the existence problem for compact forms, with particular
  attention to the case when there is an action by a large group on $J\\backslash
  H/\\Gamma$. I will also make some remarks on a conjecture of Kobayashi on the scarcity
  of compact forms."
