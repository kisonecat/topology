title: Model-categorical aspects of $\infty$-categories
abstract: This is a pre-talk for the main talk on Thursday afternoon, for those interested in further technical background and ideas. In this talk, I will give a survey of a few model categories which are meant to present ``the homotopy theory of homotopy theories.''  I will particularly emphasize the theory of quasicategories, and highlight some of its convenient technical advantages.  My goal is to introduce enough of the theory that Higher Topos Theory stops looking scary and dense and starts looking exciting and readable.
