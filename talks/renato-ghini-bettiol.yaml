title: Multiplicity of solutions to the noncompact Yamabe problem
abstract: 'The Yamabe problem consists of finding a complete metric with constant
  scalar curvature in a prescribed conformal class. A landmark result in Geometric
  Analysis is that a solution always exists on closed manifolds, but the situation
  is much more delicate in the noncompact case: there are complete noncompact manifolds
  where no solutions exist. In this talk, I will discuss how certain topological techniques
  can be used to obtain infinitely many solutions on some special noncompact manifolds.
  These include products of closed manifolds with constant positive scalar curvature
  and simply-connected symmetric spaces of noncompact or Euclidean type. As a consequence,
  one also obtains infinitely many new solutions to the so-called Singular Yamabe
  problem on spheres. (This is based on joint work with P. Piccione)'
