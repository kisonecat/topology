title: Computing Abelian rho-invariants of links via the Cimasoni-Florens signature
abstract: The solvable filtration of the knot concordance group has been studied closely since its definition by Cochran, Orr and Teichner in 2003. Recently Cochran, Harvey and Leidy have shown that the successive quotients in this filtration contain infinite rank free abelian groups and even exhibit a kind of primary decomposition. Unfortunately, their construction relies on an assumption of non-vanishing of certain rho-invariants. By relating these rho-invariants to the signature function defined by Cimasoni and Florens in 2007, we remove this ambiguity from the construction of Cochran-Harvey-Leidy.
