title: The closed geodesic problem for four manifolds
abstract: We will explain why a generic metric on a smooth four manifold (with second Betti number at least three) has the exponential growth property, i.e., the number of geometrically distinct periodic geodesics of length at most l grow exponentially as a function of l. Time permitting, we shall explain related topological consequences.
