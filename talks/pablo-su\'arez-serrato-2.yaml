title: Poisson structures on smooth 4-manifolds
abstract: I will explain how to construct generic rank-2 Poisson structures on closed oriented smooth 4-manifolds. These are associated to broken Lefschetz fibrations, and also to wrinkled fibrations and their deformations. This talk is based on joint papers with L. García-Naranjo and R. Vera, and with J. Torres Orozco.
