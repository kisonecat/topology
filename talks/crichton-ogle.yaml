title: Finitely presented groups and the $\ell^1$ $K$-theory Novikov Conjecture
abstract: Using techniques developed for studying polynomially bounded cohomology,
  we show that the assembly map for $K_*^t(\ell^1(G))$ is rationally injective for
  all finitely presented discrete groups $G$. This verifies the $\ell^1$-analogue
  of the Strong Novikov Conjecture for such groups. The same methods show that the
  Strong Novikov Conjecture for all finitely presented groups can be reduced to proving
  a certain (conjectural) rigidity of the cyclic homology group $HC_1^t(H^{CM}_m(F))$
  where $F$ is a finitely-generated free group and $H^{CM}_m(F)$ is the ``maximal''
  Connes-Moscovici algebra associated to $F$.
