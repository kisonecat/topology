title: "$\\mathcal B$-bounded finiteness"
abstract: Given a bounding class $B$, we construct a bounded refinement $BK(-)$ of
  Quillen's $K$-theory functor from rings to spaces.  $BK(-)$ is a functor from weighted
  rings to spaces, and is equipped with a comparison map $BK \to K$ induced by "forgetting
  control". In contrast to the situation with $B$-bounded cohomology, there is a functorial
  splitting $BK(-) \simeq K(-) \times BK^{rel}(-)$ where $BK^{rel}(-)$ is the homotopy
  fiber of the comparison map. For the bounding class $P$ of polynomial functions,
  we exhibit an element of infinite order in $PK^{rel}_0(Z[G])$ for $G$ the fundamental
  group of a certain 3-dimensional solvmanifold.
