title: The space of pinched negatively curved metrics with finite volume and identical ends
abstract: In this talk I will show that the space of complete, pinched negatively curved Riemannian metrics with finite volume on a smooth manifold, is either empty or non-connected, provided one has control at infinity and the dimension of the manifold is large. Time permitting, I will discuss the related problem of endowing a smooth fiber bundle with extra geometric structure.
