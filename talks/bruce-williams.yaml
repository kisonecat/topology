title: Family Hirzebruch Signature Theorem with Converse
abstract: Let $X$ be a space which satisfied $4k$-dimensional Poincar\'e Duality,
  and let $\sigma(X)$ be the signature of $X$. If $X$ is a manifold, then $\sigma(X)$
  can be ``disassembled'', i.e. $\sigma(X)$ is determined by a local invariant, the
  Hirzebruch $L$-polynomial. In this talk I'll give an enriched version of $\sigma(X)$
  which is defined in all dimensions, and for dim >4, the enriched version can be
  disassembled if and only if $X$ admits manifold structure.    There is also a family
  version of this for fibrations
