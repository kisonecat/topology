abstract: We study the problem that whether the Farrell-Jones conjecture in algebraic $K$- and $L$-theories is closed under group extensions. This problem is indeed equivalent to the following two problems. The first one is that whether the conjecture is closed under taking semi-direct product with the infinite cyclic group and the second one is that whether the conjecture is closed under passage to over-groups of finite indices.  We show that the $L$-theoretic Farrell-Jones conjecture is closed under taking semi-direct products of torsion free groups with the infinite cyclic group. In particular, this implies the $L$-theoretic Farrell-Jones conjecture holds for many nearly crystallographic groups, all poly-free groups, all poly-surface groups and all groups that are extensions of torsion free non-positively curved groups and so on.  Meanwhile, we obtain an obstruction for the same result to hold for the $K$-theoretic Farrell-Jones conjecture. Our study of the second problem leads us to the proposal of a general problem in $K$- and $L$- theory. Our study of this problem  enables us to reduce the problem that whether the Farrell-Jones conjecture is closed under passage to over-groups of finite indices to some special cases.
