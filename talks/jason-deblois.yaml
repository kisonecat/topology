title: Packings of hyperbolic surfaces
abstract: 'It is well known in low-dimensional topology that ''Boroczky''s Theorem'',
  which bounds the local density of ball packings of hyperbolic space, also yields
  sharp density bounds for such packings of hyperbolic manifolds in certain circumstances.  Using
  this fact, in 1996 C. Bavard characterized the ''extremal'' closed hyperbolic surfaces:
  those which admit an embedded disk of largest possible radius.  I will discuss the
  characterization of non-compact extremal surfaces of finite volume, which required
  new ideas.  Then I''ll report what I know (not much) about the case of several-disk
  packings of hyperbolic surfaces.'
