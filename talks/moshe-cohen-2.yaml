title: 'Kauffman''s clock lattice as a graph of perfect matchings: a formula for its
  height.'
abstract: " Kauffman gives a state sum formula for the Alexander polynomial of a knot
  using states in a lattice that are connected by his clock moves.  We show that this
  lattice is more familiarly the graph of perfect matchings of a bipartite graph obtained
  from the knot diagram by overlaying the two dual Tait graphs of the knot diagram.\\nUsing
  a partition of the vertices of the bipartite graph, we give a direct computation
  for the height of Kauffman's clock lattice obtained from a knot diagram with two
  adjacent regions starred and without crossing information specified.\\nWe prove
  structural properties of the bipartite graph in general and mention applications
  to Chebyshev or harmonic knots (obtaining the popular grid graph) and to discrete
  Morse functions.\\nThis talk is accessible to those without a background in knot
  theory.  Basic graph theory is assumed."
