title: New topological invariants for a continuous nonzero complex valued function
abstract: 'Given a compact ANR $X$ and $f : X \to \mathbb{C} \setminus 0$ a continuous
  map, for any $0 \leq r \leq \dim X$, one proposes three monic complex valued polynomials
  $P_{r,s}(z)$, $P_{r,a}(z)$ and $P_{r,m}(z)$, with $\deg(P_{r,s}(z) = \beta_r(X)$
  where $\beta_r(X)$ is the r−th Betti number, $\deg(P_{r,a}(z) = \beta_r^N(X,f)$,
  where $\beta_r^{N}(X,f)$ is the $r$−th Novikov Betti number, $P_{r,m}(z)$ a homotopy
  invariant of $f$. The first two are continuous assignments with respect to compact
  open topology, the last is locally constant (on the space of continuous functions
  with compact open topology).'
