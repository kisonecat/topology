title: 'The isometric embedding problem:  manifolds vs. polyhedra, rigidity vs. flexibility'
abstract: 'This talk will mostly be a survey on what is known about the isometric
  embedding problem for various types of metric spaces.  We will compare and contrast
  the known results for manifolds and polyhedra, and we will classify these results
  into two types:  those that are "flexible" vs. those that are "rigid".  If time
  permits, we will discuss what is known for more general types of metric spaces.'
