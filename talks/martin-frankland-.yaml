title: The homotopy of p-complete K-algebras
abstract: Morava E-theory is an important cohomology theory in chromatic homotopy
  theory. Rezk described the algebraic structure found in the homotopy of $K(n)$-local
  commutative E-algebras, via a monad on $E_\ast$-modules that encodes all power operations.
  However, the construction does not see that the homotopy of a $K(n)$-local spectrum
  is L-complete (in the sense of Greenlees-May and Hovey-Strickland). We show that
  the construction can be improved to a monad on $L$-complete $E_\ast$-modules, and
  discuss some applications. Joint with Tobias Barthel.
