title: Rational homotopy theory, fibrations and Maurer-Cartan higher products
abstract: It is well known that every even positive degree cohomology class of a finite dimensional cell complex pulls back to zero in the total space of some fibration over the cell complex, where the fibre is finite dimensional. For odd degree cohomology classes, however, there are obstructions. In this talk, I will talk about how to characterize these obstructions by using the rational homotopy theory. For all finite dimensional connected cell complexes, we give a complete description, in term of Maurer-Cartan higher products, of the subspace of rational cohomology classes that pull back to zero under fibrations with finite dimensional fibre. This talk is based on joint work with A. Gorokhovsky and D. Sullivan.
