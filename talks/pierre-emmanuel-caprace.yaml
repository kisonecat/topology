title: Rank one elements in Coxeter groups and CAT(0) cube complexes
abstract: This talk centers around the Rank Rigidity Conjecture for groups acting properly and cocompactly on CAT(0) spaces. After discussing some generalities on the conjecture and some of its consequences, I will focus on the two special cases alluded to in the title.
