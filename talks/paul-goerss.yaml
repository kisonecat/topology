title: Picard groups in stable homotopy theory
abstract: In any symmetric monoidal category $C$, the Picard group is the group of
  isomorphism classes of invertible objects. For the usual stable homotopy category,
  the only invertible objects are the sphere spectra $S^n$, with $n$ an integer. However,
  if $E_\star$ is a good (i.e., complex-orientable) homology theory, Mike Hopkins
  noticed that the $E$-local stable homotopy category could have a rich and curious
  Picard group---and that this group could give information about how homotopy theory
  of spectra reassembles from localizations. I'll review this theory, revisit some
  of the curious examples, and report on recent calculations. This is joint work with
  Hans-Werner Henn, Mark Mahowald, and Charles Rezk.
