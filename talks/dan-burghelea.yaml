title: Refinements of Betti numbers
abstract: In this talk I will propose a refinement of the Betti numbers provided by
  a continuous real valued map. These refinements consist of monic polynomials in
  one variable with complex coefficients, of degree the Betti numbers. A number of
  remarkable properties of these polynomials will be discussed.\nIn case X is a Riemannian
  manifold these refinements can be even "more refined"; One can assign to the map
  and each nonnegative integer a collection of mutually orthogonal subspaces of the
  Harmonic forms = deRham cohomology in degree labelled by the zeros of the above
  mentioned polynomials and of dimension the multiplicity of the corresponding zero.\nIf
  the map is a Morse function the polynomials can be calculated in terms of critical
  values of the map and the number of trajectories of the gradient of the Morse function
  between critical points.
