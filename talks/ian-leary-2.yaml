title: Infinite Smith groups and Kropholler's hierarchy I
abstract: This talk concerns actions of (discrete) groups on finite-dimensional contractible
  simplicial complexes.  I call a group G a `Smith group' if every action of G on
  a finite-dimensional contractible simplicial complex has a fixed point.  (The P
  A Smith theorem tells us that every finite p-group is a Smith group; there are no
  other finite Smith groups.)\nKropholler's hierarchy assigns an ordinal to a group,
  describing how simply it can be made to act on a finite-dimensional contractible
  simplicial complex.  Finite groups are at stage 0 of the hierarchy and stage 1 contains
  all groups that act on a finite-dimensional contractible simplicial complex without
  a fixed point.  Until our work, no group was known to lie in the hierarchy beyond
  stage 3.\nWe construct an infinite Smith group, and construct groups that show that
  for countable groups, Kropholler's hierarchy is as long as it possibly could be.\nIn
  the talks, I will describe some fixed-point theorems and explain some aspects of
  our group constructions.  The first talk will focus on Smith groups and the second
  on Kropholler's hierarchy.\nJoint with G Arzhantseva, M Bridson, T Januszkiewicz,
  P Kropholler, A Minasyan and J Swiatkowski.
