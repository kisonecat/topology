title: Quasi-isometries of graph manifolds do not preserve non-positive curvature
abstract:  In this talk, we will see the definition of high dimensional graph manifolds and see that there are examples of graph manifolds with quasi-isometric fundamental groups, but where one supports a locally CAT(0) metric while the other cannot.  We will use properties of the Euler class as well as various results on bounded cohomology.
