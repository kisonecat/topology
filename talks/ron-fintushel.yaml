title: Surgery on nullhomologous tori and smooth structures on 4-manifolds
abstract: By studying the example of smooth structures on $CP^2 \# 3(-CP^2)$, I will
  illustrate how surgery on a single embedded nullhomologous torus can be utilized
  to change the symplectic structure, the Seiberg-Witten invariant, and hence the
  smooth structure on a 4-manifold.
