title: Algebraic G-theory via twisted deformation theory
abstract: 'We review some old problems in algebraic topology--namely, the classification
  of finite-dimensional modules over subalgebras of the Steenrod algebra, and related
  classification problems in representation theory and finite CW complexes--and some
  old techniques in deformation theory--namely, the use of Hochschild 1- and 2-cocycles
  with appropriate coefficients to classify first-order deformations of modules and
  algebras, respectively. Then we work out how one has to adapt these old methods
  to solve these old problems, ultimately using some modern technology: a deformation-theoretic
  interpretation of twisted nonabelian higher-order Hochschild cohomology.'
