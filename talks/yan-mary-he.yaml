title: Basmajian-type identities and Hausdorff dimension of limit sets
abstract: Basmajian's identity expresses the length of the boundary of a compact hyperbolic surface as a summation over the orthogeodesics on the surface. In this talk, I will introduce Basmajian-type series identities on limit sets associated to familiar complex dynamical systems. In particular, I will show how to extend Basmajian's identity to certain Schottky groups via analytic continuation. I will also discuss Basmajian-type identities for quadratic polynomials and its applications to Hausdorff dimension of Julia sets.
