title: Equivariant Rigidity of Quasi-toric Manifolds
abstract: We show that quasi-toric manifolds are topologically equivariant rigid with the natural torus action. The proof of the rigidity is done in three steps. First we show that for the manifold equivariantly homotopy equivalent to the quasi-toric manifold the action of the torus is locally standard (it resembles the standard action of the torus on the complex space). The second step is that the manifold is equivariantly homeomorphic to the standard model of such actions. The final step is based on the topological rigidity of the quotient space which is a manifold with corners. This is joint work with Vassilis Metaftsis.
