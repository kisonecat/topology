title: Satellite operators as a group action
abstract: Let $P$ be a knot in a solid torus, $K$ be a knot in $3$-space and $P(K)$
  be the satellite knot of $K$ with pattern $P$.  This correspondence defines an operator,
  the satellite operator,  on the set of knot types and induces a satellite operator
  $P:C\to C$ on the set of smooth concordance classes of knots.  In a recent paper
  with Tim Cochran and Arunima Ray, we show that for many patterns this map is injective.  I
  will approach this result from a different perspective, namely by showing that satellite
  operators really come from a group action.   In 2001, Levine studied homology cylinders
  over a surface modulo the relation of homology cobordism as a group containing the
  mapping class group.  We show that this group also contains satellite operators
  and acts on an enlargement of knot concordance.  In doing so we recover the injectivity
  result.  I will also present some preliminary results on the surjectivity of satellite
  operators on knot concordance.
