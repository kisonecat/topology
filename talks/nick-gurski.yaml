title: K-theory for 2-categories
abstract: K-theory is the machine that turns symmetric monoidal categories into spectra.  I
  will discuss work, joint with Niles Johnson and Ang\'elica Osorno, in which we study
  a version of K-theory in which the input is a symmetric monoidal 2-category.  My
  ultimate goal will be to discuss our proof that symmetric monoidal 2-categories
  model connective spectra.
